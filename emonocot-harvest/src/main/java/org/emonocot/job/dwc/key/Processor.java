/**
 * This is slightly different from the description validator because we believe
 * (or at least, I believe) that descriptive content is somehow "owned" or
 * "contained in" the taxon i.e. that if the taxon does not exist, the
 * descriptive content doesn't either. There is a one-to-many relationship
 * between taxa and descriptive content because there can be many facts about
 * each taxon, but each fact is only about one taxon.
 *
 * Images, on the other hand, have an inherently many-to-many relationship with
 * taxa as one image can appear on several different taxon pages (especially the
 * family page, type genus page, type species page etc). Equally a taxon page
 * can have many images on it. So Images don't belong to any one taxon page
 * especially. If we delete the taxon, the image can hang around - it might have
 * value on its own.
