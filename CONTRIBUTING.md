## Code Formatting

In an effort to keep formatting consistent across the code base, please
use the provided "Emonocot" eclipse code formatting profile.

In Eclipse go to

    Window -> Preferences

In the preferences window, select

    Java -> Code Style -> Formatter -> Import

Select the `code-style.xml` file in the emonocot root and set the Active Profile to "Emonocot"
